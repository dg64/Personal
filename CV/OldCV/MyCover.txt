While in Saiag, I had the opportunity to be involved in many migrations, due to an aggressive acquisition strategy pursued by my company; that opportunity gave me the chance to achieve a global perspective  about the industrial processes,  no matter how they were implemented by several ERPâ€™S;  in almost eleven years I worked in many areas, logistic, sales, suppliers, production; these experiences were very helpful when I was in charge of the revision of executive financial reporting.
I spent my first year in Stratos as a project manager in the Business Intelligence division; I worked at two big projects: the first one was for Siemens who was looking for a data-warehouse and a data mining system meant to monitoring the telecommunication costs; the second one was for a big insurance company who needed a data-warehouse and a reporting system. After one year and a half I started to work for the Document Management division; at that time my company was covering only the mainframe market, and I volunteered to explore the market of unixes and windows platforms. Since then I worked at many projects, from the pre-sale phase to the final realization; I am used to make written proposals, write specifications, lead projects and people, integrate different processes, no matter which platform do they are executed. I am used to handle several projects at one time and to work under a tight schedule
In the Document Management division I worked at many big projects, most of them for credit institutes; usually these projects were developed the three phases: installation and customization of the document archiving solution, integration with the production environment, developing of a web application in order to access the archived data.
In the end I have played several roles in my career; I dealt with big and small companies; in the big companies I developed a global view about business processes and in the small companies I developed a strong orientation to the result. I think that, the know how  of both world, and my flexibility to face and solve new problems, makes me suitable for new challenges and greater responsibilities.
