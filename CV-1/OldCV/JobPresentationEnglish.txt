Hello, my name is Domenico Galizia. My experience is in Program / Project Management.

I have just concluded a project for a russian manufacturing company, meant to implement from scratch a MES system for production control in real time, and an APS system, for production and material requirement planning.

Beside that, my expertise encompasses several branches, both technological and functional; my career both as internal project manager and consultant gave me a broad vision about the business processes and a strong orientation to the result.

I am currently looking for a challenging position as IT Manager; i believe to have the necessary skill and I think that is time for me make profit of my past background.
